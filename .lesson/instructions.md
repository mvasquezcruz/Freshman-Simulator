# Adventure  
Create a text-based adventure game.  These games are classically fantasy-based, but yours doe not need to be.  Here is an example to give a sense of what your game-play *could* look like:
```
--------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the village of Endoreign!  The people here are friendly and are always up for a chat. 

What would you like to do? 
  1. Visit the tavern 
  2. Visit the blacksmith 
  3. Travel 
> 2

You enter the blacksmith's house to him hard at work forging swords.  His apprentice is sharpening blades.  The blacksmith, a man named Dragonblazer, welcomes you in and asks you how he can help.  

What do you do? 
  1. Ask to see what he has for sale 
  2. Offer to sell him something from your inventory 
  3. Say goodbye and leave 
> 3

You say goodbye to Dragonblazer who wishes you a good day.  You return to the town square.  

Welcome to the village of Endoreign!  The people here are friendly and are always up for a chat. 

What would you like to do? 
  1. Visit the tavern 
  2. Visit the blacksmith 
  3. Travel

The more creative the better, but here are some required components:
- **Inventory**.  Every good adventure game involves an inventory. 
- **Choice**. Throughout the adventure, the user should be asked to make choices which determine the trajectory of their adventure.  
- **A consistent map**. That is, the user should be able to accurately map out their adventure as they go and there should not be inconsistencies.  For example, if a user leaves a town and travels North, then travels back South, they shouldn't find something else where the town used to be.  
- **Money**. The user should have the opportunity to purchase items.  These don't need to affect the game necessarily, but *could*.  For example, a user who has purchased a sword may have the opportunity to fight a dragon, whereas a user who has no weapon might always lose or simply not have the opportunity to fight.  

## Advice
It is *highly recommended* that you map out your game before you start coding.  If it would help, start with a very basic and try to get it to work.  Then add more, always debugging along the way. 

Comment your code as you work.  This project could have a lot of code, but the logic is not too complicated.  You will want to comment your code and keep it organized so you can more easily pick up where you left off.
